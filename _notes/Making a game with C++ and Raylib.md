A bit of context:

I gotten my hands on a course that was intro to writing games with C++. While it wasn't perfect, I got some starting point and inspiration - Raylib seems low level enough to get me with "all the fun", but high enough so I don't need to manually manage all OpenGL, which felt a bit too much at a time.

I'm documenting my journey, all with wins, fails and lessons I got along the way.
