I have noticed interesting pattern. While two examples are not entirely enough, I decided to try to test this hypothesis when opportunity arises.

Long time ago, I decided to start writing in mirror mode. Because it's way easier for a left-handed person to write that way. I approached the challenge very `logically`. I started practicing letters, but kinda got nowhere after a while. Then I just started writing. It went way better than "dry exercise" and I've been writing like this ever since.

Second case: Korean keyboard. Same thing, I started with typing exercises etc, but then just started writing, even without Korean layout visible. I still make mistakes, but I've seen huge improvement once I started writing and not just doing rewrites.

My hypothesis here is there are skills (maybe even all?) that benefit greatly from "real world" and not "isolated exercises". Don't write letters. Write text.
