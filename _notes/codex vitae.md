This is my Codex Vitae, a list of things I believe/follow in life. Feel free to take anything that resonates, but please remember those are things that work for me and may not necessarily work for you.

## people
- Don't be a dick
- Give everyone a chance, but if they turn out to be not worth the time - remove from life
- Remember about [[excuse hydra]] and avoid it.
- If you can give some value to someone with low/zero cost - do it.
- Unsolicited help/advice is worse than lack of it

## philosophy
- Stoicism seems to work really well 
- Don't suffer imagined troubles - if something bad has not happened yet, it's not terrible.
- You can prepare for the bad thing thou - just don't get stressed about something
- Happiness comes from things you have control over - from the inside
- You don't have control over other people's reactions
- You do have control over your own reaction - anger is easily managed by stopping for a second before reacting
- Treat every situation like a hand in a card game - you try to play best what you're given, not complain about what you got.
- There's no "inherent fairness" to the world, some people will have better/worse start than you had - don't waste time and energy complaining about it
