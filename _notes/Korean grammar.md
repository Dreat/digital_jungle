### Formal vs Casual {#formal}

There are two ways of communicating in Korean

존댓말 - formal one. More polite, good `default` mode.
반말 - informal one - to be used with friends

Usually the difference is adding -요 to the end. Also, if there are many ways of saying/writing something, the longer one is more polite one.

| 존댓말                      | 반말                |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- |
| 안녕하세요                    | 안녕                |
| 안녕히 가세요/잘 가요             | 안녕 / 잘 가!         |
| 안녕히 계세요 / 잘 지내요! / 잘 있어요 | 안녕 / 잘 지내 / 잘 있어! |
| 저                        | 나                 |
| -씨, -님                   | 너, -야/-아          |
| 네 / 예                    | 응 / 어 >> 웅 / 엉    |
| 아니요 / 아니에요               | 아니 / 아니야          |
| 이거 뭐예요?                  | 이거 뭐야?            |
| 이거 뭐였어요?                 | 이거 뭐였어?           |
| 내일 일 할 거예요               | 내일 일 할 거야         |

Politeness levels are determined by the verb ending. There are three basic verb endings used to express different politeness levels
1. -ㅂ니다 = the most polite and most formal ending
2. -(아/어/여)요 = the polite, natural and slightly formal ending
3. 아/어/여 = the casual, informal and intimate ending

반말 can be only used:
1. with someone who is younger
2. someone of the same age
3. someone with whom you agreed to mutually use 반말
If other person's age or social status is not known, do not use 반말. Once you know other's person's age and find out they are younger than you, you can use 반말, however it's safer, as well as a nice gesture, to ask the person whether you can use 반말.

Common cases for using 반말
1. You are much older
2. You are older than the other person and you got their permission to use 반말
3. You are the same age and you got their permission to use 반말
4. Students in same age group
5. Talking to yourself or writing in a diary/journal

Common cases to **NOT** use 반말
1. You know the other person only through work and not personally
2. You are older than the other person, but they are your business client or customer
3. You are older than the other person, but you are talking in an official environment (like business meeting, seminars, lessons)
4. You just met the other person.
5. You are younger and never got permission from the other person to use 반말 with them
6. You are the same age, but you are both adults and you do not know each other that well
7. You are older, but the other person is your boss
8. You are older than the other person, but they are the spouse of your sibling
9. You are talking to a large group of people or filming a video blog

How to ask for 반말?

If you are the older one
```
말 놔도 돼요? = May I speak 반말 with you?
말 = language, word
놓다 = put down
말을 놓다 literally means "put down the language" or "lower the language"

말 편하게 해도 돼요? = May I speak comfortably with you?
편하다 comfortable
편하게 comfortably
```

If you are the younger one
```
말 놓으셔도 돼요 = You can speak casually with me
놓다 >> 놓으시다

말 편하게 하셔도 돼요 = You can speak comfortably with me
하다 >> 하시다
```

If you are of the same age
```
우리 말 놓을까요? = Shall we speak 반말 to each other?
말 편하게 해도 되죠? (-지요=--죠) = I can talk in 반말 with you, right?
```


### What {#what}

###### What + verb -> 뭐 + verb
example: 뭐 했어요? -> What did you do?

###### What + noun = what kind of -> 무슨 + noun
example: 무슨 책 좋아해요? - what kind of books do you like?

### Time {#time}

AM = 오전
PM = 오후
hour = 시
minutes = 분

time format: 오전/오후 + NK number + 시 + SK number + 분

year = 년 
month = 월
day = 일

date format: SK + 년 + SK + 월 + SK + 일

### Counting {#counting}

what + NK number + counting word

example: 책 다섯 권 = five books

|word|what it counts|comments|
|---|---|---|
|살|age (years old)|can't use 개|
|명|people|can't use 개|
|마리|animal|can't use 개|
|병|bottle||
|벌|clothes||
|개|"thing"|can be used for other words unless specified otherwise|
|그루|tree||
|켤레|a pair||
|장|paper, page, ticket|also works for e-tickets|
|권|book||
|대|car, phone, tv|from what I understand "expensive" things|
|조각|piece||
|송이|flower||
|컵|cup|for cheap/take-away coffee etc|
|잔|glass|for expensive/proper coffee cup etc|

### Subject markers {#subject}

**-은/-는**

"unlike other things"

"different from other things"

**example**

이거는 사과예요.

(The other things are not apples, but) this is an apple.

-이/-가

**example**

이 책이 좋아요.

This book is good

(there are no other books as good as this one)

1. Once mentioned, a subject is given `은/는`. The subject is turned into a topic.
	- 그 강아지는 예뻐요 = The dog is pretty
	- 공원에 강아지가 있어요 = There is a dog at the park
2. `은/는` can be also used for things that are not subjects. Use `은/는` when it means _this topic is a little_ **different** _from other topics_
	- 여기에 한국인이 많아요. 근데 저는 미국인이에요. = There are a lot of Koreans here. But I am American
	- 저는 강아지를 좋아하는데 고양이는 안 좋아해요 = I like dogs, but I don't like cats
3. If **the subject** is important, use `이/가`. If anything other than the subject is more imporant, use the `은/는`.
	- 누가 드랫이에요? 제가 드랫이에요. (Who is Dreat? I am Dreat => **I(저)** is more important than the name)
	- 이름이 뭐예요? 제 이름은 드랫이에요 (저**는** **드랫**이에요 / 드랫이 제 이름이에요) = What is your name? My name is Dreat (I am Dreat) (name is more important than `I(저)`)

### Object markers {#object}

-을/-를

### Present tense {#present}

1. Ends with ㅏ or ㅗ = add 아요
2. Doesn't end with ㅏ or ㅗ  = add 어요
3. Ends with 하 = add 여요

### Past tense {#past}

1. Ends with ㅏ or ㅗ = add 았어요
2. Doesn't end with ㅏ or ㅗ  = add 었어요
3. Ends with 하 = add 였어요

### Future tense {#future}

Add -(으)ㄹ 거예요.

or

Add -(으)ㄹ 게요 to focus more on actions or decisions as a reaction/result of what the other person says or thinks


### Present progressive (-ing) {#ing}

Add -고 있어요

### Want {#want}

Add -고 싶어요

#### Do you want to...? -(으)ㄹ래요?
It is built based on the future tense. It is used when expressing the intent of the will to do something. With question mark it changes to "do you want to...?". When used as a statement it can mean "I want to..." or "I am going to...".

1. 집에 가고 싶어요 = I want to go home (most general and vague way)
2. 집에 갈게요 = (if so) I will go home (looking for feedback / reacting to the situation)
3. 집에 갈 거예요 = I am going to go home (most direct)
4. 집에 갈래요 = something between "I want to go home" and "I am going to go home"

혼자 할래요 vs 혼자 할게요 -> second sounds much nicer, but both mean "I will do it alone"

저는 안 가래요 (I do not want to go/I am not going to go) vs 저는 안 가고 싶어요 (If you really insist, I might go)

### Negation {#negation}

1. 안 before verb
2. negative verb ending -지 않다

2. past tense: verb stem + -(으)ㄴ 것

1. present tense: verb stem + -(으)ㄴ 것
2. future tense: verb stem + -(으)ㄹ 것
### Can/cannot do {#cancannot}

1. Drop 다
2. Add (으)ㄹ 수 있다/없다

(for feelings only descriptive form can be used for other people)

### Place {#place}

-에 = at, to, in

**example**

학교에 갔어요 - I went to school

-에서 = at, in, from

used to

1. Describe where action is taking place (도서관에서 궁부했어요 = I studied in the library)
2. Describe "from place" (서울에서 왔어요 = I came from Seoul)

- 밖에 = literally outside something, _other than something_, out of range of something

`Noun + -밖에 + negative conjugations`

in general -만 and -밖에 are interchangeable, but
1. You need negative form with -밖에
2. -밖에 is used more
3. -밖에 cannot be used with imperative sentences
4. When verb has a negative meaning, -만 is more commonly used (저는 닭고기만 싫어해요 = I only hate chicken)

### Making Adjectives {#adjectives}
 `+ -(으)ㄴ + 명사 (noun)`

In English "pretty" is an adjective and can be found in a dictionary.
In Korean "pretty" is "예쁜", but it cannot be found dictionaries. The "descriptive verb" or "the adjective in infinite form" is "예쁘다" and can be found in the dictionary.

- 싸다 is not "cheap". It means "to be cheap"
- 바쁘다 is not "busy". It mean "to be busy"
- 맛있다 is not "delicious". It mean "to be delicious"

In Korean adjectives can be conjugated to different tenses, for example

- 재미있다 (to be fun)
- 재미있어요 (present tense)
- 재미있었어요 (past tense)
- 재미있을 거예요 (future tense)
(vs English It is fun/ It was fun/ It will be fun; `fun` is always the same)

**Exceptions:**
- 하얗다 -> 하얀 (white; 하얀 가방 - white bag) 
- 그렇다 -> 그런 (such; 그런 가방 - that kind of bag)
- 달다 -> 단 (sweet)
- 있다 -> 있는
- 없다 -> 없는

**Common mistake**
- 예쁜 + 이에요 𐄂 -> 예뻐요 ✓
- 비싼 + 이에요 𐄂 -> 비싸요 ✓
- 라떼 한 잔 주세요. 따뜻한 - 𐄂 (can't be without noun)
- 라떼 한 잔 주세요. 따뜻한 라떼. ✓

**Action verbs can be also used as adjectives**

action verb -는 + noun (for verbs ending with ㄹ, drop ㄹ)

- This is **a bag I like**
- 이 가방은 제가 **좋아하는 가방**이에요.
- This bag is **a bag I liked**
- 이 가방은 제가 **좋아한 가방**이에요.
- This bag is **a bag I will like**
- 이 가방은 제가 **좋아할 가방**이에요.

- Someone who Yeji likes -> 예지씨가 좋아하는 사람
- Someone who likes Yeji -> 예지씨를 좋아하는 사람

- Is there a Korean food that you eat often? -> 자주 먹는 한국 음식 있어요?
- Is there a cafe that you go to often? -> 자주 가는 카페 있어요?


### Well then, In that case, If so {#wellthenifso}

그러면, 그럼 

```
if, in case = 만약 -(으)면, or -(으)면
to be so = 그렇다
```


그러면 is `그렇다 + (으)면` and literaly means ("then" or "in that case")

if you say **그럼!/그럼요** it mean "of course!" or "naturally!"

### Let's {#lets}

A few different ways to say `let's` in Korean

1. - 아/어/여요 (polite/plain)
2. -(으)시죠 (honorific)
3. -자 (informal)
4. -(으)ㄹ래요? (polite/casual)
5. -(으)실래요? (polite/formal)


### In order to, For the sake of {#inorderto}

위해, 위해서 = in order, for

위하다 => 위해 (위하여) / 위해서 (위하여서)

noun + -을/를 위해서
- 건강을 위해(서) = for health/for the sake of health/in order to be healthy
- 회사를 위해(서) = for the company/for the good of the company

"위해(서)" in a sentence sounds very formal. In casual, spoken conversation -(으)려고 or 위한 is used

### Maybe I might {#maybeimight}

-(으)ㄹ 수도 있어요 = 
- it could...
- it is possible that...
- it might

1. -(으)ㄹ 수 있다 -> can, to be able to
2. -도 -> also, too

The word 수 is a noun which means "way", "method" or "idea". Therefore -(으)ㄹ 수 있다 means "there is a way to do...", "there is an idea for doing..." or "there is a possibility for doing..."

Adding -도 (too/also) changes the meaning to "to also be able to do something".

It usually means "it might", "it could" or "perhaps".

- to meet = 만나다
- might meet = 만날 수도 있다
- we might meet again tomorrow = 내일 다시 만날 수도 있어요

**important**:
1. I might not come here tomorrow => 저는 내일 다시 안 올 수도 있어요
2. I might not be able to come here tomorrow
	- 저는 내일 다시 올 수 없을 수도 있어요
	- 저는 내일 다시 몾 올 수도 있어요


### -네요 verb ending {#neyo}
It is used in case of being impressed, surprised, or one's own personal thought. This is used quite frequently

Verb stem + -네요

- 크네요! = (I see that) it is big! / (I did not know it was but, but) is it big. (expressing surprise)
- 잘 어울리네요! = Oh, I think that it looks good on you (expressing impression)
- 맞네요 = I see that it is correct! (Finding out a fact for the first time)
- 여기 있네요! = oh, here it is!
- 벌써 11원이네요 = wow, it is already November

### The more ..., the more... {#themorethemore}

-(으)면 -(으)ㄹ수록

the more A(verb), the more B(verb) = A-(으)ㄹ수록 B

examples:
- The more delicious it is, the better is sells = 맛있을수록 잘 팔려요
- The more busy you are, the more important your health is = 바쁠수록 건강 더 중요해요
- The more people, the better = 사람이 많을수록 더 좋아요

-(으)ㄹ수록 can also mean (depending on context of conversation)
- "Even more so, especially when..." - 학생일수록 책을 많이  읽어야 돼요 = You need to read a lot of books, even more so if you are a student
- "Especially if..." or "Even more..." 
- "Particularly when..." - 바쁠수록 더 자야 돼요 = You need to sleep more, particularly when you are busy

If you want to emphasise a bit more, you can use -(으)면 before -(으)ㄹ수록

- The busier you are... = 바쁠수록 = 바쁘면 바쁠수록
- The better is it... = 좋을수록 = 좋으면 좋을수록

**갈수록** comes from 가다 + -(으)ㄹ수록. It literally means "the more you go", but it's used as "more and more so in time" or "as time goes by"
- It keeps getting colder = 갈수록 추워요
- Dreat keeps getting better at Korean - 드랫은 갈수록 한국어를 잘해요
